h1. &#x2192; 'capitate'

h2. What

Capistrano plugins, recipes and templates.

h2. Installing

<pre syntax="ruby">sudo gem install capitate</pre>

Create a Capfile (in your project):

<pre syntax="ruby">capitate .</pre>

Create and set a profile in you Capfile:

<pre syntax="ruby">load "config/deployment/centos-sick.rb"</pre>

<em>See profiles section below for more info</em>


h2. The basics

Capitate has recipes for:

* Installing applications, via package manager or manually building with make.
* Common deployment setup and update_code tasks, such as symlinking in database.yml and more advanced recipes such as sphinx configuration.
* ERB templates for application configuration files, init scripts, monit configuration, etc.
* And more...


h3. Profiles

Profiles are capfiles which store lists of recipes to run for cap install and deploy and settings for those recipes.

For an example profile, see "centos-sick.rb":http://svn.ducktyper.com/capitate/trunk/lib/profiles/centos-sick.rb

TODO: More on profiles...


h3. Install recipes

To install a group of applications based on a profile:

  cap install

<em>You may need to comment out "Defaults requiretty" in /etc/sudoders on the image before capistrano recipes will work.</em>

  
h3. Deploying (application)

If this is the first time you've deployed you'll need to run:

  cap deploy:setup

Otherwise, your standard deploy options:
  
  cap deploy

  cap deploy:migrations (deploys and does migration)
  
  cap deploy:migrate (only does migration on existing deployment)
