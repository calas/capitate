= Configr

The idea is to have:

* A central configuration file (since alot of configuration is shared between mongrel, sphinx, rails, etc.)
* Use (erb) templates to generate configuration files and the capistrano configuration itself
* Use rake tasks
* Use capistrano with recipes


== Creating image

  cap centos:install (For centos image)
  
You may need to comment out "Defaults requiretty" in /etc/sudoders on the image before capistrano recipes will work.
    
    
== Deploying (application)

If this is the first time you've deployed you'll need to run:

  cap deploy:setup

Otherwise, your deploy options:
  
  cap deploy

  cap deploy:migrations (deploys with migrations)
  
  cap deploy:migrate (only does migration on existing deployment)


== Freezing gems

You must freeze all gems (excluding core ones like mongrel, ruby-mysql, etc):

Freeze rails:
  rake rails:freeze:edge TAG=rel_2-0-2
  
Gemsonrails:
  http://gemsonrails.rubyforge.org/
