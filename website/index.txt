h1. &#x2192; 'capitate'

h2. What

Capistrano plugins, recipes and templates.

h2. Installing

<pre>sudo gem install capitate</pre>


h2. Running

Add capitate to your Capfile. Copy this somewhere near the top:

<pre syntax="ruby">require 'capitate'  
require 'capitate/recipes'
set :project_root, File.dirname(__FILE__)
</pre>


h2. The basics

Capitate has recipes for:

* Installing applications, via package manager or manually building with make.
* Common deployment setup and update_code tasks, such as symlinking in database.yml and more advanced recipes such as sphinx configuration.
* ERB templates for application configuration files, init scripts, monit configuration, etc.
* And more...


h3. Beefing up your deploy

For an example deploy, see "centos-sick.rb":http://svn.ducktyper.com/capitate/trunk/lib/profiles/centos-sick.rb

You could copy this profile into config/deployment/ and add it to your Capfile:

  load "config/deployment/centos-sick.rb"



h3. Use recipes

"View recipes documentation":recipes/index.html

For example, to script the install of a group of applications as root, use "recipes:run":recipes/recipes.html:

Configure your Capfile to run it:

<pre syntax="ruby">
set :recipes_run, [ "ruby:centos:install", "memcached:centos:install" ]
set :recipes_user, "root"
</pre>

Then run:

  cap recipes:run

This is just a basic example.
